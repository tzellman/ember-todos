ember-todos
===========

Yet another fork of the *wildly* popular Todos application.

What I set out to do:
* Use ember with AMD/require, borrowing heavily from existing Todo apps
* Use yeoman to manage the configuration

To use:
* Install yeoman
* Run the built-in yeoman server

```bash    
    yeoman server
    yeoman build; yeoman server:dist
```
